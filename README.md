### I love this Manga so I decided to make this repo for It's Covers!

* Description:
`
Shindo Manabu is a high school student in the Elite Course of his school whose goal is to get into Tokyo University, having previously failed to get into his school of choice to follow the girl he liked in middle school. He studies constantly and tries to never lose sight of that goal. That is until his childhood friend, neighbor and schoolmate from the Sports Course Amano Megumi starts to distract him. He originally only remembered her as the tomboy she was as a kid, until they meet up again and he notices how "developed" she has become (but still tomboyish) and how much she unwittingly shows her body with her unladylike behavior. As these two get closer to each other, hilarity often ensues and subsequently, Manabu becomes more and more distracted from his goal of getting into Tokyo U ... and slowly noticing the affection Megumi has for him. Can he ever hope to avoid a girl who is so stunning in heart and body? Will she ever reach his heart? ... or does she already have a place in there that neither of them have discovered?
